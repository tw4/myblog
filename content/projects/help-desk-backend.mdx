# Help Desk Application Development Project

In this project, we are developing a basic help desk application for businesses and organizations that want to provide customer support. Additionally, we have plans to expand this into an advanced help desk application.

## Key Features

- **Categorizing Support Tickets:** Support tickets can be categorized into different categories, helping to manage issues more effectively.

- **Assigning Support Tickets:** Support tickets can be assigned to relevant staff members or teams, enabling faster issue resolution.

- **Real-time Messaging on Support Tickets:** Ticket owners and the support team can engage in real-time messaging for quicker communication and issue resolution.

- **Support Performance Reporting:** The application provides reporting features to monitor the performance of the support team, offering valuable insights to the business.

## Advanced Features

- **Multi-Language Support:** The application offers support in different languages to cater to international customers.

- **Automatic Ticket Creation:** Users can automatically create tickets for issues that meet specific criteria.

- **Ticket Preview:** Users are provided with a preview of the ticket before creation to prevent errors.

- **Ticket Archiving:** Completed or closed tickets can be archived and stored for reference.

- **Ticket Reminders:** Automatic reminders can be set for unresolved tickets within a certain timeframe.

- **Ticket Authorization:** Ticket authorization can be configured for different users and roles.
